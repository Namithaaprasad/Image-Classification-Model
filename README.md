# Image-Classification-Model
Image classification model by building a CNN and using Tensorflow

This project focuses on building a deep learning model for image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Leveraging the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32Ã—32 color images across 10 different classes, the model is trained to accurately classify images such as airplanes, cars, birds, and more. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, normalization, and model construction using either PyTorch or TensorFlow. The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. Additionally, training loss progression is visualized, and sample predictions are displayed to demonstrate the model's performance. This project deepened my understanding of computer vision, CNN architectures, and the practical application of deep learning in real-world image recognition tasks.
